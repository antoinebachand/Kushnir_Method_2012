# Kushnir_Method_2012
This project implements in MATLAB the method proposed by Kushnir et al. (2012) in Renewable Energy. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931012003766.
Based on the mass and energy conservation equations, Kushnir et al (2012) derived a numerical and approximate analytical solution  for the air cavern temperature and pressure variations. However, this solution does not account for leakage
